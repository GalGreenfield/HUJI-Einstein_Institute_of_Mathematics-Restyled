--DESCRIPTION--

This is a new UI for The Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Einstein Institute of Mathematics. I use this code in the TamperMonkey extension for browsers, which executes JavaScript scripts. This code creates code that is injected into the pages of the Einstein Institute for Mathematics's website, and also contains JavaScript scripts that TamperMonkey executes. For more information about TamperMonkey, go to: https://tampermonkey.net.
